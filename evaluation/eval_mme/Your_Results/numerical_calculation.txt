0020.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 9? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No, the answer to the arithmetic question in the image is 4.
0020.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 45? Please answer yes or no.	No	No, the answer to the arithmetic question in the image is 4 + Σ = 45. The equation in the image is correct but the final result shown, "= 45," is incorrect. The correct answer is the number 4 plus the sum of the Greek letter Σ and the equal sign, which equals 45.
0014.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 200? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No.
0014.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 400? Please answer yes or no.	No	No, the answer to the arithmetic question in the image is 300, not 400. The equation 300 - 100 = 300 demonstrates that when subtracting a larger number from a smaller one, the result remains the same.
0013.png	Is the area of the right triangle in the picture equal to 24? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No, the area of the right triangle in the picture is not equal to 24. The triangle is a right triangle with a base length of 8 and the height is labeled as 6 on the paper. The formula to find the area of a right triangle is \( A = \sqrt{h^2 + (b^2)} \). For the triangle in the picture, you would have \( A = \sqrt{6^2 + (8^2)} \), which is approximately 24. However, the number 24 is not marked in the triangle or written anywhere else on the paper, so this is likely an incorrect or an unfinished calculation.
0013.png	Is the area of the right triangle in the picture equal to 8? Please answer yes or no.	No	No. The right triangle in the picture has a base length of 6 and an angle of 8. The area of a right triangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which is A = √((base² + angle²) / 4). For a right triangle with base 6 and an angle of 8, the area would be A = √((6² + 8²) / 4). However, 6² is 36, and 8² is 64. The area would be A = √(36 + 64) / 4, which is approximately 23.8. This is not equal to 8, so the answer to whether the area is equal to 8 is no.
0009.png	Should the value of "a" in the picture equal 2? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No. The value of "a" in the picture equals 9.
0009.png	Should the value of "a" in the picture equal 3? Please answer yes or no.	No	Yes.
0003.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 65? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No, the answer to the arithmetic question in the image is 29 + 36 = 65.
0003.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 56? Please answer yes or no.	No	No. The image shows the equation 29 + 36. The answer to this equation is 65.
0007.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 49? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No. The arithmetic question in the image is incorrect because the equation 14 + 3s equals 49. The actual result should be 17.
0007.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 39? Please answer yes or no.	No	Yes.
0015.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 11? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No, the answer to the arithmetic question in the image is 100 - 999 = 10.
0015.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 111? Please answer yes or no.	No	No. The arithmetic question in the image is 100 - 999.
0019.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 18? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No, the answer to the arithmetic question in the image is 36, not 18. The equation 36 ÷ 2 equals 2.
0019.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 36? Please answer yes or no.	No	No.
0017.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 14? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No, the answer to the arithmetic question in the image is 3, not 14. The expression `(23-3x4)+3` is being evaluated. The calculation is `(23-3*4)+3`. The `*4` means that 4 is multiplied by 3, so the number is 3*4 = 12. The final answer is 3 + 12 = 15, but it is not 14.
0017.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 83? Please answer yes or no.	No	No. The arithmetic expression in the image is \( (23-3x)(3+x) = 3 \), and the answer is indeed 83. However, it looks like the person may have written \( 23-3x(3+x) = 3 \) instead of \( (23-3x)(3+x) = 3 \). This mistake results in the answer being \( 23-3x(3) = 0 \), which is incorrect. The correct answer should be \( (23-3x)(3+x) = 3 \), which is equivalent to \( 23-3x(3+x) = 3 \) and \( (23-3x)(3+x) = 3 \) when \( 3+x = 3 \).
0012.png	Should the value of "a" in the picture equal 9? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No. The image shows "l a=10," which suggests that the letter "a" is being compared to the value "10" with the equal sign indicating that the comparison is true. In mathematics, the letter "a" is often used as a variable, which would typically represent a number, a set of values, or another type of value depending on the context. In the context of a numbering system, the value of a letter "a" would generally not equal 9. If "a" is meant to represent the number 9, then the correct statement should be "l a=9."
0012.png	Should the value of "a" in the picture equal 1? Please answer yes or no.	No	Yes.
0002.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 340? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No.
0002.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 17? Please answer yes or no.	No	No.
0005.png	Is the area of the square in the picture equal to 40? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No. The area of the square is equal to 25, as it is a right-angled triangle with a base length of 5 units and a height of 8 units. The area is calculated by multiplying the base by the height: 5 × 8 = 40, which is incorrect.
0005.png	Is the area of the square in the picture equal to 8? Please answer yes or no.	No	No, the area of the square in the picture is equal to 5, as indicated by the number "5" drawn inside it.
0006.png	Is the area of the square in the picture equal to 9? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No. The area of the square is not equal to 9. It's equal to 3, as indicated by the number next to the square.
0006.png	Is the area of the square in the picture equal to 3? Please answer yes or no.	No	No. The area of the square in the picture is 0, as indicated by the empty box and the number 3 next to it.
0001.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 225? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No, the answer to the arithmetic question in the image is 15.
0001.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 1515? Please answer yes or no.	No	No. The arithmetic question in the image asks for 16 multiplied by 15. The answer should be 160, not 1515.
0016.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 9? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No.
0016.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 16? Please answer yes or no.	No	No. The arithmetic question in the image is "18 ÷ 2," and the answer is "9," which is written beneath the division sign.
0011.png	Is the area of the parallelogram in the picture equal to 24? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No. The area of the parallelogram in the picture is equal to 6, as indicated by the written numbers "6 6" along its base.
0011.png	Is the area of the parallelogram in the picture equal to 6? Please answer yes or no.	No	Yes. The parallelogram drawn in the picture has an area of 6, as indicated by the number next to it.
0004.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 33? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No.
0004.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 32? Please answer yes or no.	No	No.
0008.png	Should the value of "a" in the picture equal 7? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	Yes.
0008.png	Should the value of "a" in the picture equal 14? Please answer yes or no.	No	No. The expression in the image is "a + 7 = 11." According to basic arithmetic, when you add the values of two numbers, you get the sum of the values. If 11 were the sum, the value of "a" in the picture would not equal 14, as 14 is not a number that can be produced from 7 + 11. The correct answer should be a number less than or equal to 11.
0018.png	Should the value of "a" in the picture equal 3? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	Yes, according to the equation shown in the picture, "a" equals 3.
0018.png	Should the value of "a" in the picture equal 2? Please answer yes or no.	No	No. The expression you've shown is not correct. The equation a - 2 equals 3 is not a valid mathematical statement.
0010.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 13? Please answer yes or no.	Yes	No.
0010.png	Is the answer to the arithmetic question in the image 12? Please answer yes or no.	No	No, the answer to the arithmetic question in the image is not 12. The equation 10 + 3 ≠ 12 is a correct mathematical statement, but the answer should be 11, since 11 is the number that is not equal to 12 when adding 10 and 3.
